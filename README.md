# 🟡 Pac-Man Style Game with A* Pathfinding AI (Python & Pygame)

A **Pac-Man–inspired grid-based game** built using **Python and Pygame**, featuring an intelligent ghost that chases the player using the **A\* pathfinding algorithm**.  
This project focuses on **game AI, pathfinding algorithms, and real-time gameplay mechanics**.



## 🚀 Project Overview

The player navigates through a procedurally generated maze, collecting goals while avoiding a ghost that continuously calculates the shortest path using **A\* search with Manhattan distance heuristics**.

This project demonstrates practical applications of:
- Artificial Intelligence in games  
- Pathfinding algorithms  
- Procedural maze generation  
- Real-time event handling  



## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **A\* Pathfinding Algorithm** for intelligent ghost movement  
- 🧱 **Procedural Maze Generation** with guaranteed connectivity  
- 🎮 **Real-time Player Controls** via keyboard input  
- 🔄 **Dynamic AI Re-planning** when the player moves  
- 🖥️ **Grid-based Rendering** with sprite-based characters  
- 🏆 **Score System** with randomly generated goal tiles  



## 🧠 AI & Pathfinding

- The ghost uses the **A\*** algorithm to find the shortest path to the player  
- **Manhattan distance** is used as the heuristic function  
- Path re-planning occurs:
  - When the player moves  
  - At fixed frame intervals  

This creates **adaptive and challenging gameplay**.
